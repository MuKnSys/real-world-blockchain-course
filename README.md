The purpose of the Real World Blockchain Course, developed by [Web3 Enabler](https://web3enabler.com) is to bring education about cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology to the masses.

After hosting the [Real World Blockchain podcast](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLt68TvyH77C0V4z6asL2OOJqrCuSguHiq) since Q1 of 2024, the Web3 Enabler team was inspired to turn our discussions into a course!
